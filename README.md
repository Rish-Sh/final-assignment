Australian Domestic Flight Data Analysis

Overview: This project provides a comprehensive analysis and visualization tool for Australian domestic flight data. The application includes features for data exploration, trend analysis, city pair comparison, load factor analysis, city-specific data summary, and the relationship analysis between flight distance and passenger load factor.

Data Description and Sources: The dataset used in this project comprises Australian domestic flight data, which includes details on flight routes, passenger numbers, aircraft trips, load factors, and more. The data is pivotal for understanding travel patterns, airport traffic, and route popularity within Australia.

Source: The dataset is sourced from Australian Government's Open Data Portal, which provides access to a wide range of public datasets. The specific dataset used in this project can be found under the 'Transport and Infrastructure' section and is regularly updated to reflect the most recent trends in domestic flights.

Features: 
Data Exploration: Explore detailed flight data with various filtering options. 
Trend Analysis: Visualize trends in passenger trips between selected city pairs. 
City Pair Comparison: Compare passenger trips trends for two selected city pairs. 
Load Factor Analysis: Analyze the load factor for flights between chosen city pairs. 
City Specific Data Summary: Get a summary of key statistics for a specific city. 
Distance vs. Passenger Load Analysis: Investigate the relationship between flight distance and load factor.

Installation: To run this project, you will need the following:
Python 3.x Required Python libraries: matplotlib, PySimpleGUI, pandas Install the necessary libraries using pip:
To start the application, run the main Python script: python final-assignment.py

Examples: 
Example 1: Data Exploration Window Launch the data exploration window using the following code: 'data_exploration_window()'
Example 2: Analyze Load Factor of a City Pair Analyze the load factor between two cities with this function: '''city1 = "Sydney" city2 = "Melbourne" canvas = tkinter.Canvas() # Replace with an actual canvas object analyze_city_pair_load_factor(city1, city2, canvas) '''

Thank you for reading, we hope you enjoy our project :)
